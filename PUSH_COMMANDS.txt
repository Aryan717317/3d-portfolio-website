# GitHub Push Commands

After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands in order:

## Replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username

# 1. Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/3d-portfolio-website.git

# 2. Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# 3. Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

## If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
# - Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# - Or configure SSH keys

## Your repository will then be live at:
# https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/3d-portfolio-website
